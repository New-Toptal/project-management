## What is this and who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I do React consulting and this is a showcase product I've built in my spare time. It's a very good example of modern, real-world React codebase.

There are many showcase/example React projects out there but most of them are way too simple. I like to think that this codebase contains enough complexity to offer valuable insights to React developers of all skill levels while still being _relatively_ easy to understand.

It is not fully completed as a project management system, but the basic functions are implemented, so there wouldn't be big problems using this project. But if you want to add some more functions you can add to it's codebase.

## Features

- Implement "Create issue" function
  - Select Issue Type
  - Input Short Summary
